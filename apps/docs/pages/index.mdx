# Introduction

A/BBY is a Micro-SaaS that was created during the Dynaweek Hackathon.

It aims to be the simpliest way to do A/B testing and Feature Flags on your website.

We tried to make A/BBY as simple as possible and create the **best** user experience. Therefore we decided to focus on `React` and `Next.js` for now.

## Getting Started

Before you're able to use A/BBY, you need to create a free account first.
After you created your account you're able to use A/BBY. Make sure to read the [React Docs](/integrations/react) to get started.

## Philosophy

Here are some of the things that we believe in:

- **Simplicity** - We believe that A/B testing should be as simple as possible. That's why we created A/BBY.
- **Security** - All data is hosted in Europe and the code is open source.
- **Transparency** - We don't store any user related data, everything is saved anonymously.
