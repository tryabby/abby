### Usage

#### Create your Instance

To use Abby in your code you will need to create a typed Hook and Provider first. You can do this by using the `createAbby` function.
Please copy the id of your project from the dashboard to get started.

```jsx
import { createAbby } from "@tryabby/react";

const { AbbyProvider, useAbby } = createAbby({
  projectId: "<YOUR_PROJECT_ID>",
  currentEnvironment: process.env.NODE_ENV,
  tests: {
    test: { variants: ["A", "B"] },
    footer: { variants: ["dark", "orange", "green"] },
    // ... your tests
  },
  flags: { darkMode: "Boolean", newFeature: "Boolean" },
});
```

#### Wrap your Application

You will need to wrap your application with the `AbbyProvider` to make sure the hook works.
If you're using Next.js you should do this in the `_app.js` file.

### Hooks

You can now import the hooks created by `createAbby` and use it in your components.

#### useAbby

The `useAbby` hook returns an object with the following values:

- `variant` - The variant that is currently active
- `onAct` - A function that you can call to trigger any kind of interaction with the tested component (will be used to track conversions)

```tsx
import { useAbby } from "./abby";

function MyButton() {
  const { variant, onAct } = useAbby("footer");
  return (
    <main className="p-6">
      <h1>Abby Test Page:</h1>
      <button
        className={`rounded-lg py-2 px-4 
        ${variant === "dark" && "bg-gray-900 text-white"} 
        ${variant === "orange" && "bg-orange-500 text-white"} 
        ${variant === "green" && "bg-green-500 text-white"}`}
        onClick={onAct}
      >
        Cool Button
      </button>
    </main>
  );
}
```

#### useFeatureFlag

The `useFeatureFlag` hook returns a boolean value that indicates if the flag is active or not.

```tsx
import { useFeatureFlag } from "./abby";

function HomePage() {
  const hasNewFeature = useFeatureFlag("newFeature");

  return (
    <main className="p-6">
      <h1>Welcome back, User</h1>
      {hasNewFeature && <p>Here is the new feature</p>}
      <p>This is our super boring page</p>
    </main>
  );
}
```
