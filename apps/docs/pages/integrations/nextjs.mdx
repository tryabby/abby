# Next.js

Our Next.js integration works with Next.js 12 or later. It uses the React SDK under the hood and just has some additional features for Next.js.

## Installation

To get started make sure to install the package using your favorite package manager.

<Tabs items={["npm", "yarn", "pnpm"]}>
  <Tab>
    ```bash
    npm i @tryabby/next
    ```
    </Tab>

  <Tab>
    ```bash
    yarn add @tryabby/next
    ```
</Tab>
  <Tab>
    ```bash
    pnpm i @tryabby/next 
    ```
    </Tab>
</Tabs>

### Create your config

To use Abby you need to create your config first. You can do this by creating a file called `abby.config.ts` in your `root` folder. This file will be used to configure your project.

```ts
// abby.config.ts
import { defineConfig } from "@tryabby/next";

export default defineConfig({
  projectId: "<YOUR_PROJECT_ID>",
  currentEnvironment: process.env.NODE_ENV,
  environments: ["production", "development"],
  tests: {
    test: { variants: ["A", "B"] },
    footer: { variants: ["dark", "orange", "green"] },
    // ... your tests
  },
  flags: ["darkMode", "newFeature"],
  remoteConfig: {
    customButtonText: "String",
  },
});
```

### Create your Instance

To use Abby in your code you will need to create a typed Hook and Provider first. You can do this by using the `createAbby` function.
Please copy the id of your project from the dashboard to get started.

```tsx
import { createAbby } from "@tryabby/next";
import abbyConfig from "../abby.config";

const { AbbyProvider, useAbby, withAbby } = createAbby(abbyConfig);
```

### Wrap your Application

You will need to wrap your application with the `AbbyProvider` to make sure the hook works.
This is done in the `_app.tsx` / `_app.js` file in your Next.js project.

```tsx
import { AbbyProvider } from "../lib/abby";

function MyApp({ Component, pageProps }) {
  return (
    <AbbyProvider>
      <Component {...pageProps} />
    </AbbyProvider>
  );
}

export default MyApp;
```

<Callout type="info" emoji="ðŸ’¡">
  If you want to improve the experience read the following section.
</Callout>

By default the `AbbyProvider` will fetch the data from the server on the first render (client side). This can be improved by using the `initialData` prop. This will make sure the data is already available on the first render
This works really well with Static Site Generation (SSG) and Server Side Rendering (SSR).

```tsx /withAbby(MyApp)/
import { AbbyProvider, withAbby } from "../lib/abby";

function MyApp({ Component, pageProps: { __ABBY_PROJECT_DATA__, ...pageProps } }) {
  return (
    <AbbyProvider initialData={__ABBY_PROJECT_DATA__}>
      <Component {...pageProps} />
    </AbbyProvider>
  );
}

export default withAbby(MyApp);
```

## Usage

For the hook usage please read the [React SDK](/integrations/react#usage) documentation.
