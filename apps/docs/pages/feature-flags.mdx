# Feature Flags

A feature flag in Abby is basically just a boolean that can be toggled via the Dashboard in Abby.
This is useful for testing new features, or for hiding features that are not yet ready for production.

A feature flag is always toggled for a certain [Environment](/environments) which allows you to test features in different environments.
For example, you can have a feature flag that is enabled in the `development` environment, but disabled in the `production` environment.

## Basic Usage

When a feature flag is toggled for an environment, every user will see the same value for that feature flag.
If you want to test a feature for a specific user, you can use [A/B Tests](/a-b-testing).

## User Segments & Conditional Rules

Feature flags can be made more powerful with user segments and conditional rules. This allows you to dynamically control flag values based on user properties.

### User Properties

First, define the properties you want to use for targeting in your user segment schema. Common properties include:

- User role/type (string)
- Subscription status (boolean)
- Usage metrics (number)
- Location (string)
- Custom attributes specific to your app

### Conditional Rules

Once you have user properties defined, you can create conditional rules for your feature flags:

- **Single Rules**: Simple conditions like "role equals admin" or "subscriptionActive equals true"
- **Rule Groups**: Complex logic combining multiple conditions with AND/OR operators
- **Operators**: Support for various comparisons:
  - Strings: equals, not equals, contains, not contains, starts with, ends with, regex
  - Numbers: equals, not equals, greater than, less than, greater/less than or equal
  - Booleans: equals

### Example Usage

Here's how it works:

1. Define your user properties in the Abby dashboard
2. Create rules for your feature flags using these properties
3. Update user properties in your application code:

```typescript
// Update user properties
abby.updateUserProperties({
  role: "admin",
  subscriptionActive: true,
  usageCount: 100,
});
```

When evaluating feature flags, Abby will:

1. Check the environment value first
2. Evaluate any conditional rules based on user properties
3. Return the appropriate flag value

This allows for powerful targeting scenarios like:

- Enable features only for admin users
- Show premium features to paid subscribers
- Roll out features gradually based on usage metrics
- Target specific user segments with custom rules
