# Feature Flags

A feature flag in Abby is basically just a boolean that can be toggled via the Dashboard in Abby.
This is useful for testing new features, or for hiding features that are not yet ready for production.

A feature flag is always toggled for a certain [Environment](/environments) which allows you to test features in different environments.
For example, you can have a feature flag that is enabled in the `development` environment, but disabled in the `production` environment.

When a feature flag is toggled for an environment, every user will see the same value for that feature flag.
If you want to test a feature for a specific user, you can use [A/B Tests](/a-b-testing).
