# A/B Tests

Abby allows you to define different tests for your application.
A test is uniquely identified by a name. After creating a test you can define weights for each variant of the test.
By default all variants have the same chance.

When implementing a test in you application you can show different things depending on the selected variant.
The variants will be assigned to users randomly, but the same user will always get the same variant.
The assignment of variants uses the defined weights.
