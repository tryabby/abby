# Configuration as Code

## Introduction

A/BBY aims to have the best Developer Experience possible.
This is why A/BBY is fully configurable via Code. No need to click some buttons in a GUI.
You `abby.config.ts` (or `abby.config.js`) file is the **single source of truth** for your A/BBY project.

Your configuration should be written in a file called `abby.config.ts` (or `abby.config.js`) which should be located in the root of your project.
Every integration offers a `defineConfig` helper function which offers a typesafe way to define your configuration.

```ts
import { defineConfig } from "@tryabby/core";
// or import { defineConfig } from "@tryabby/<integration>";
```

The config needs to be the default export of the file so that the CLI can find it.

```ts
import { defineConfig } from "@tryabby/core";
// or import { defineConfig } from "@tryabby/<integration>";

export default defineConfig({
  // your config here
});
```

## Philosophy

This configuration has two purposes:

#### 1. Integrations

A/BBY has many integrations to other tools and frameworks. Those can import the config and use it to configure themselves.
For example the `@tryabby/nextjs` integration uses the config to configure the Next.js framework. Reading the config makes the integrations fully typesafe

#### 2. CLI

The [A/BBY CLI](/reference/cli) uses the config to know what to do. It reads from the config and can then be used to create tests or feature flags on the A/BBY platform without
any further configuration.

## Example

```ts
// abby.config.ts

import { defineConfig } from "@tryabby/core";
// or import { defineConfig } from "@tryabby/<integration>";

export default defineConfig({
  projectId: "my-project-id",
  currentEnvironment: "development",
  environments: ["development", "production"],
  tests: {
    SignupButton: {
      variants: ["A", "B"],
    },
  },
  flags: {
    AdvancedTestStats: "JSON",
    showFooter: "Boolean",
    maxUserCount: "Number",
  },
});
```
