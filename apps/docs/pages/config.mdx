# Configuration as Code

A/BBY aims to have the best Developer Experience possible.
This is why A/BBY is fully configurable via Code. No need to click some buttons in a GUI.
You `abby.config.ts` (or `abby.config.js`) file is the **single source of truth** for your A/BBY project.

Your configuration should be written in a file called `abby.config.ts` (or `abby.config.js`) which should be located in the root of your project.
Every integration offers a `defineConfig` helper function which offers a typesafe way to define your configuration.

```ts
import { defineConfig } from "@tryabby/core";
// or import { defineConfig } from "@tryabby/<integration>";
```

The config needs to be the default export of the file
