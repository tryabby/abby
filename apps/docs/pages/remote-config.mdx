# Remote Configuration variables
Remote Configuration variables are custom String, Number and JSON values, which you can control per [Environment](environments)

They behave similarly to Feature Flags, but allow you to control more types of values than just booleans.
You could for example display a dynamic string on your page, which you can easily change on the A/BBY Dashboard for all users.

The [A/BBY Devtools](devtools) also allow you to control Remote Configuration variables in realtime during development,
providing a nice developer experience.
